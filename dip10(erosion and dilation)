THEORY: Erosion (usually represented by ) is one of two fundamental operations (the 
other being dilation) in morphological image processing from which all other 
morphological operations are based. It was originally defined for binary images, later 
being extended to grayscale images, and subsequently to complete lattices.  
With A and B as two sets in Z2 (2D integer space), the dilation of A and B is defined as  
A(+)B={Z|(B ̂)Z∩A ≠ ɸ}  
In the above example, A is the image while B is called a structuring element.  
In the equation,(B ̂)Z simply means taking the reflections of B about its origin and shifting it 
by Z. Hence dilation of A with  
B is a set of all displacements, Z, such that (B ̂)Z and A overlap by at least one element. 
Flipping of B about the origin and then moving it past image A is analogous to the 
convolution process. In practice flipping of B is not done always.  
Dilation adds pixels to the boundaries of object in an image. The number of pixels added 
depends on the size and shape of the structuring element. Based on this definition, dilation 
can be defined as  
A(+)B={{Z|(B ̂)Z∩A} ϵ A}  


% Read the input image 
f = imread('coins.png'); 
% Define structuring elements 
B = [0 1 1; 1 1 1; 0 1 0]; % Structuring element for dilation 
se = strel('disk', 10); % Structuring element for erosion 
% Perform dilation 
f1 = imdilate(f, B); 
% Perform erosion 
f2 = imerode(f, se); 
% Display the results
